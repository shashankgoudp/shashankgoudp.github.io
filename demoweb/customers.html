<p>Where there is a will, there is a way...

I am originally from Hyderabad, India. I came to United States of America on July 30th 2014 with a dream of pursuing my master's at NCSU. Since then I am staying at Raleigh and completing my master's degree. I am enjoying every bit of my education at NCSU. Apart from studies, I also got the opportunity to be part of various social organisations and contribute for well being of people of Raleigh. Currently, I am in my final semester of the degree program.

At US, I had some of the best experiences of my life. Here I met people from lot of different parts of the world and I managed to learn their culture and make lot of friends. Now US is like my second home and I want to stay here and explore lot of great opportunities.

Currently, I am looking for full time jobs in a software domain starting January 2016. Through this job, I plan to apply my knowledge of master's as well as gain some industry experience in my field of study.
Want to know more about me..</p>
